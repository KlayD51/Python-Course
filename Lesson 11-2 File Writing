Objectives:
-Cool Uses for File Reading
-File writing

Do Now:
Step 1: Go to google classroom - click blue python-course
Step 2: Open lesson 11-1(you will use the code from the first example)
Step 3: Open exampleText.txt , you can either take the Don Quixote text or the knicks text
Step 4: Go to replit in the left hand bar, click the icon to make a new file, name the file, once created paste your text there
Step 5: go back to main.py and put the example code from 11-1 in there
Step 6: change the name of the file in the code to whatever you named your file you created

What can we do with file writing: 

----count words in a text Ex: lines 17-28

number_of_words = 0
 
with open(r'knicks.txt','r') as file:

    data = file.read()
 
    lines = data.split()
 
    number_of_words += len(lines)
 
 
print(number_of_words)



----find the most common letter used in a text Ex: lines 35-41


from collections import Counter

with open('knicks.txt') as f:
    counts = Counter(f.read())

print('\n'.join(f'letter "{letter}": {count}' for letter, count in counts.items()
                if letter != '\n'))


----read and remove words from text Ex: lines 46-57

reading_file = open("knicks.txt", "r")

new_file_content = ""
for line in reading_file:
    stripped_line = line.strip()
    new_line = stripped_line.replace("won", "almost won")
    new_file_content += new_line +"\n"
reading_file.close()

writing_file = open("knicks.txt", "w")
writing_file.write(new_file_content)
writing_file.close()



File Writing:
-File writing lets us write content to a file of our choice
-Careful you don’t overwrite a file that already has contents
-You can do whatever you’re doing and have that saved permanently in a file after you’ve cleared your terminal

X = create - will create file, error if already exists
A = append - will create a file if the specified file doesn’t exist
W = write - will create a file if the one used doesn’t exist

Ex:

f = open("knicks.txt", "a")
f.write("The Knicks will probably always be mid!")
f.close()

Ex, with function:
llines 79-85

def example(date):
  return 'Hello, today ' + date


f = open("knicks.txt", "a")
f.write(example("5/4/23"))
f.close()
