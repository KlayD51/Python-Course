Objectives:
-Understanding methods
-Using built-in methods
-Documentation sourcing

Do Now:
-Go to https://trinket.io
-Go to https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html

The first link open's trinket.io and the second link is the documentation(how to use) for the animation.

What is Trinket.io?
Trinket.io gives you pre made methods to use to animate a small python graphic.  These methods can be found 
in the documentation.  You have to read what the method you want to use accepts as input to use it in your code.

Excercise:
Pick two methods from the second link to animate your turtle, use them in your template to animate your turtle
to use them you will need to read the documentation and see how to correctly use the methods given.  Start with
moving in a direction, or somethinhg simple, them maybe a more complex method.


I will attach an example of code that I made that uses Trinket.io

Sample Code:(lines 26-55) - some animation the turtle can do

# You can edit this code and run it right here in the browser!
# First we'll import some turtles and shapes: 
from turtle import *
from shapes import *

# Create a turtle named tutle:
turtle = Turtle()
turtle.shape("turtle")
turtle.speed(7)
turtle.color("yellow green")
turtle.fillcolor("violet")

# Movement
turtle.forward(25)
turtle.left(45)
turtle.circle(180)  # draw a semicircle
turtle.dot(20, "black")


#turtle speed
turtle.speed('normal')

# Write a little message:
turtle.penup()
turtle.goto(0,-50)
turtle.color("black")
turtle.write("Intro to Turtles 101", None, "center", "16pt bold")
turtle.goto(0,-80)

# Try changing draw_circle to draw_square, draw_triangle, or draw_star





Here is a template to get you started animating:(lines 61-82)

from turtle import *
from shapes import *

# Create a turtle named tutle:
turtle = Turtle()
turtle.shape("turtle")

# Movement
turtle.forward(10)
turtle.left(10)


# Write a little message:
turtle.penup()
turtle.goto(0,-50)
turtle.color("purple")
turtle.write("Turtle Template", None, "center", "16pt bold")
turtle.goto(0,-80)

# Try changing draw_circle to draw_square, draw_triangle, or draw_star
