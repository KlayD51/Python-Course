Lesson 10-1

Objectives:
-Refractoring
-How to turn something into a function

Do Now:
-Make a function that multiplies 3 numbers together


Refractoring:
-Refractoring is when you go back and make your code better
-Usually this means making it easier to read
-This could also mean updating it to a better way
-Or if something new comes out using new resources
-Think of it as bettering something you already had

What can you do to refractor?
-You can better organize
-You can turn something into a function
-You can update something that isnâ€™t available anymore(deprecated)


Example:
We are going to put the line below into a function instead(refractor)

A = 4
B = 8
C = a + b
Print(c)

A = 16
B = 29
C = a + b
Print(c)


After Refractoring:


Def addFunct(a, b):
	c = a + b
	print(c)

addFunct(4, 8)
addFunct(16, 29)

Now have them put this into a function:

A = 10
B = 14
C = (a / b) + 25
Print(c)


If more time put loops into a function(RPS Game).
