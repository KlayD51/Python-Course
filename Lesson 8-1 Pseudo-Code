Lesson 8 -1 

Objectives:

-Pseudo-Code?
-Pseudo-Code for rock, paper, scissors?
-How to break an app into manageable pieces?

Pseudo-Code:
Natural language written to emulate the needs of code that we may want to implement.  Instead of writing the actual 
code you write what the code should do, save the heavy lifting for later.

Why do we Write Pseudo Code?
We write pseudo-code because it helps us to know what we are doing before we actually start, like an outline.  You 
really want to avoid having to go back and fix things or re-code things because your logic was wrong, or you didn’t 
account for everything.   It happens of course, but why do more than you have to? 

Pseudo-Code Example:

What are we introducing a game with?
Everyones favorite rock-paper-scissors!


Guess what?  You’re going to help me figure out what we need for our rock-paper-scissors game.

First we need to break what we need to do into smaller objectives(I will help, you just need to remind me how the 
game is intended to work).

How do we start the game?
How do we know how to play?
How do we get the choice of the person playing the game?
Etc.

Game logic Pseudo-Code:













Next class we will code our Rock-Paper-Scissors game using the logic we made this class
