Objectives:
-File I/o
-Reading and Writing to file
-Why we may want to read/write to file?

File I/o:
-A method for us to be able to write and read from a file
-What is file reading?  File reading allows us to have our program read the contents of a file for us and we may utilize that information later
-What is file writing?  File writing allows us to add content to a file outside your program
-Reading/Writing allows us to manipulate files outside our program however we specify, a very useful ability when dealing with data

File Paths:
-Everything in your machine(computer) is organized based on file system
-In the same way you can tell a program how to navigate your files in order to find the right one
-Basic syntax:   “User/documents/school/python coding”
-User is the account, documents specifies the next level, school folder is within documents on the next level, python coding is a folder within documents,…After that we may specify which file we want specifically


To open the file, use the built-in open() function.
The open() function returns a file object, which has a read() method for reading the content of the file:

Ex:

f = open("demofile.txt", "r")
print(f.read())



By default the read() method returns the whole text, but you can also specify.

Ex: Read 5 lines

f = open("demofile.txt", "r")
print(f.read(5))



You can return one line by using the readline() method:

Ex:
f = open("demofile.txt", "r")
print(f.readline())



Loop through the file line by line:

f = open("demofile.txt", "r")
for x in f:
  print(x)



It is a good practice to always close the file when you are done with it.

Ex:
f = open("demofile.txt", "r")
print(f.readline())
f.close()



f.close()To read a file’s contents, you can call f.read(size), which reads some quantity of data and returns it as a string. size is an optional numeric argument. When size is omitted or negative, the entire contents of the file will be read and returned

Ex:
f = open('my_file', 'r')
print(f.read(10))


Program to return word count: \/

file = open("C:\data.txt", "r")

#read the content of file
data = file.read()

#get the length of the data
number_of_characters = len(data)

print('Number of characters in text file :', number_of_characters)
