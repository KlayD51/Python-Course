Lesson 7-1

Do Now: Import practice

This do now is to show you some more imports that you can use:

Try this code below:
—————————————
from art import *
  
# return multiple art as str
art__0=art("woman",number=10)
  
print(art__0)
—————————————-

Try this code also
—————————————-
from tqdm import tqdm
import time
for a in tqdm(range(100)):
   time.sleep(2)
—————————————


Objectives:
-Import refresher/practice
-import use cases
-examples of import use cases
-bridge previous lesson with import use


Examples of Imports that would be used in actual code practice: 
Bisect(a module that allows you to bisect your list)
-Allows you to insert an element in sorted order
-You haven’t learned sorting or time complexity but adding things in order saves you a lot of time
-demonstrate how it would usually be done
——————————————
import bisect as bs

ls = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90]
bs.bisect(ls, 9)
—————————————


NumPy(a module that lets you manipulate lists)
-Has plenty of methods to manipulate data structure
-great for data manipulation
-the code below will splits the array into equal subsection

—————————————
import numpy as np

x = np.arange(8.0)
np.array_split(x, 3)

print(x)

print(np.array_split(x,3))
————————————


-you would be surprised how useful methods that remove whitespace,
Or split an array can be for you
-let modules do menial tasks for you so you can focus on logic
-They speed up your work process and are tested and true usually with a community 
that catches mistakes
