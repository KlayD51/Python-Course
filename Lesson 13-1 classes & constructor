Lesson 13-1

Objectives:
-What is a constructor?
-What is a class?
-What is an object?

Do Now:
Think of any object that you want to create, give them 5 details to their character.


Classes:
-classes allow us to partition our code into sections that are pertinent to just that thing
-for example we can give all the information for a basketball class that could let us be able 
to play a basketball game
-This class could have anything from how large and how much air a ball should have to calculating
how may times it should bounce based on air pressure
-The point is that classes aford you the ability to break up your code into relevant sections

Ex: Making a class named person

class person:


Constructor:
-Remember the onject you thought of?
-A constructor allows you to tell python exactly what our "thing" should be characterized by
-Think ht, weight, color, smell, etc.(a useful descirption of whats needed)
-This is how we can include what we want and functions as a way to start thinking about the real 
needs of your program
-Syntax:: you need to start with the def __init__(self) and include each attribute as a parameter like below

Ex: Making a constructor for person.

def __init__(self, name, age, bornDay):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age
    self.bornDay = bornDay
    
    
Object:
-An object in python allows us to send information in the form of a little entity we created
-Instead of sending a number to, we could send an object with the ID for a customer with a total of 10
-This allows the code to be cleaner and more flexible + more secure

Ex: Making an object from a class(we gave a name, age, and date of birth)

MiniPerson = person("Darnell Mini", 6, "12/6/07")


Full Example:(lines 55-66)

class OnlineBank:
  
  def __init__(self, ID, name, accountNumber, routingNumber, address):
    self.ID = ID
    self.name = name
    self.accountNumber = accountNumber
    self.routingNumber = routingNumber
    self.address = address

DarlasAccount = OnlineBank(0, "Darla James", 10291001, 20026722, "179 Houston Ave, East Atlanta")

print(DarlasAccount)

print(DarlasAccount.routingNumber)
