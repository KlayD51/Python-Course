Objectives:
What are stacks?
How can we use them?
FIFO vs LIFO?

Do Now: Loop through the word “Douglas” with a for loop.  I’ll give you the variable holding the word and you have to loop through it.

Copy from lines 9-14

DoNowWord = "Douglas"

For _ in DoNowWord:
	print(_)

What is a stack?
-A stack is a data structure very much like a list that holds data
-Stacks work in the terms of LIFO
-LAST IN FIRST OUT, so last come first serve
-So if Johnny walks in the class last he gets to leave first since he’s at the back of the line and is closest to the door

How to use it:
.append() = add to a stack
.pop() = remove the last added element to a stack

ExampleStack = []

ExampleStack.append("A")
ExampleStack.append("B")
ExampleStack.append("C")
ExampleStack.append("D")

print(ExampleStack)

ExampleStack.pop()
ExampleStack.pop()
ExampleStack.pop()

So we can see that a stack is great to use data when you’re looking to take the last thing you added first.  You can also, take something off of a stack and use it in some other data structure.

Exercise:

1.Make a stack(colors or tv shows if you need creative help)
2.Fill your stack with your append() method
3.Print your stack when its filled
4.Lastly, remove some of the elements with pop() to see how your stack looks
5.print again to see it updated
