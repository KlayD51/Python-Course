Do Now:
Look up what the difference between a list and a dictionary in Python is(there are a few but just hold on to one)?

What is a conditional?
-A conditional allows our program to make decisions
-These decisions are based on the information that we give it
-Conditions are limited to the inputs that we allow it to receive
-Conditionals are implemented using the if, else, and elif statements
-To conceptualize it better think of it as “if this happens, then that happens”
-It gets more complicated than that but that is the basis of conditionals

How do we use a conditional?

Basic Example:
if(“Whatever you want to test”):
	“Insert whatever should happen as a result”
Else(“Whatever you want to test”):
	“Insert whatever you want to test”



First Version:
 #Tests if the first number is bigger
if firstNumber > secondNumber:  
  print("The first num is larger than the second")
#If the first number isn't bigger then the second is bigger
else:  								
  print("The second num is larger than the first")



Better Version:

if firstNumber > secondNumber:  				
  print("The first num is larger than the second")
elif firstNumber < secondNumber:			
  print("The second num is larger than the first")
else:												
  print("The numbers are equal")

#First Condition: Tests if the first number is bigger
#Second Condition: If the first number isn't bigger then the second is bigger
#Third Condition: If neither is true then they are equal right
