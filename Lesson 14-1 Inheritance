Objectives:
-refresh classes
-introduce inheritance
-why do we need inheritance

Do Now:
Open to replit and the lesson 13-1


What is inheritance:
-Much like what it sounds like inheritance allows you to inherit something
-This thing is generally the code and methods that you have already made
-Think of it like this, if your parent bought a pack of water and it's sitting in the kietch,
why would you also go out to buy a case too
-Why not just use that case thats already in the kitchen

How do we tell python we want to inherit?
-simple, pass the name of the parent class into the parentheses of the child class
Example Below!!!!\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/ -- person is the class being inherited(so we get its constructor and methods)

Line 30 is what you want to see!!

class person:

  def __init__(self, fName, lName, email):
    self.fName = fName
    self.lName = lName
    self.email = email

class student(person):



Inheritance in action:
Run lines 38-48 !!!!!!!


class person:

  def __init__(self, fName, lName, email):
    self.fName = fName
    self.lName = lName
    self.email = email

class student(person):

  studentX = person("darnell", "johnston", "johnstonD@gmail.com")
  print(studentX.fName)



As seen above the class student inherits the contents of python so we dont have to create the same constructor again.
