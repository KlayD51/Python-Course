Do Now: Stack Refresher

-Create a Stack
-Fill you stack with 4 things(words or numbers) with .append
-Print your stack
-remove 2 or 3 elements from stack with .pop
-Print again

How to create a stack?
WhateverYourStackNameIs = []

How to fill your stack?
WhateverYourStackNameIs.append()        <——— what you add goes inside the parentheses

How to remove from stack?
WhateverYourStackNameIs.pop()

How to print your stack?
print()		<———— Whatever you named your stack 



Objectives:
-Refresh on Stack’s
-Introduce Queue’s
-Demo Queue’s

What is a Queue?
-A queue is a data structure that is much like a stack or list
-The difference is that instead of last in first out it is first in first out
-So if you get to class first you get to leave first(first come first serve)
-instead of regular .pop() you do pop(0), since you want the head to be removed

Example:

queue = []
  
# Adding elements to the queue
queue.append('a')
queue.append('b')
queue.append('c')
  
print("Initial queue")
print(queue)
  
# Removing elements from the queue
print("\nElements dequeued from queue")
print(queue.pop(0))
print(queue.pop(0))
print(queue.pop(0))
  
print("\nQueue after removing elements")
print(queue)
  

Exercise:
Change your do now stack to a queue and manipulate it.
