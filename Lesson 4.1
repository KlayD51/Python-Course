Keyword Example:

ExNumber = input("Enter info here: ")

#ex 1
if ExNumber is greater than 10:
  print("ExNumber is greater")
else:
  print("ExNumber is less")
#Explanation:
#"is" is a python key word
#and a comparison is done with a < or > symbol

#ex2
if "ExNumber is greater than 10":
  print("ExNumber is greater")
else:
  print("ExNumber is less")
#Explanation:
#"is" is a python key word
#comparison is done with < or >
#comparisons shouldnt be in "" since it is not a string

#ex3
if ExNumber is > 10:
  print("ExNumber is greater")
else:
  print("ExNumber is less")
#Explanation:
#"is" is a python key word, not for this purpose

#solution
if ExNumber > 10:
  print("ExNumber is greater")
else:
  print("ExNumber is less")

#Explanation
#simplistic
#right comparison used
