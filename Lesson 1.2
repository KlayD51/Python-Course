Variables and Data Types
These are data types(below), they allow your program to follow parameters predetermined in the code. The basic Data Types are String, integer , 
and Boolean.  You can hold just about anything you need to in a variable.  You can also reassign a variable a new data type. 

Examples of Python data types

String - natural language(speaking)
“This is a string”

Boolean - Yes or No
True
False

Integer - a regular number
5
6
7

Here is a good way to check your data type if you're not sure:
x = 5
print(type(x))

At some point you will usually lose track of things like this and it helps to quicly check.  There are planty of other methods, built in, that are just 
like this.  Many have to do with manipulating data and can easily be demonstrated.  Methods are pre made instructions so you do not have to code them
yourself.

List:
A list allows you to store information in a structure where they are seperated but easily accessible. Items in a list do not need to have the same 
data type.  
fruitList = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

Variable Assignment 
To give a variable a value it must be assigned, or you don’t have to assign a variable at all(just remember to later if necessary).

Unassigned variable
UnassignedVariable1

Assigned variable
AssignedVariable1 = 25

Null Variable(literally nothing)
NullVariable = null


Here are the common operators in python:

+ addition  --> (5 + 2)
-Subtraction  --> (5 - 2)
/ Division  --> (5 / 2)
*Multiplication  --> (5 * 2)
%Mod(gives the remainder)  --> (5 % 2)
