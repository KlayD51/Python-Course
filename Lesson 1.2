Variables and Data Types
These are data types(below), they allow your program to follow parameters predetermined in the code. The basic Data Types are String, integer , 
and Boolean.  You can hold just about anything you need to in a variable.  You can also reassign a variable a new data type. 

Examples of Python data types

String - natural language(speaking)
“This is a string”

Boolean - Yes or No
True
False

Integer - a regular number
5
6
7

Here is a good way to check your data type if you're not sure:
x = 5
print(type(x))

List:
A list allows you to store information in a structure where they are seperated but easily accessible. Items in a list do not need to have the same 
data type.  
fruitList = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

Variable Assignment 
To give a variable a value it must be assigned, or you don’t have to assign a variable at all(just remember to later if necessary).

Unassigned variable
UnassignedVariable1

Assigned variable
AssignedVariable1 = 25

Null Variable(literally nothing)
NullVariable = null


Here are the common operators in python:

+ addition  --> (5 + 2)
-Subtraction  --> (5 - 2)
/ Division  --> (5 / 2)
*Multiplication  --> (5 * 2)
%Mod(gives the remainder)  --> (5 % 2)
