Lesson 4.2

Do Now:

Make a program that asks for a secret word, if it’s correct let them in, if not they cant come in.(Fill in information where needed to make it work)

————————start copy hereVVV

#This variable holds the password you ask the person for and the other variable holds the real password so we can compare them
passwordAttempt = input(“What are you asking for?)
correctPassword = “This “is where the correct password goes

#The if statement tests if the word we got is the same as our correct password 

if passwordAttempt == correctPassword:
	print("you can come in")
else:
	print("Your not good")

Objectives:
-Refresher on conditions and input
-while loops 
-while loop demo

What are loops for?
A loop is good for anytime you want to do the same thing multiple times

-loops can be set to a certain amount of times or infinite(that might crash your machine)
-you can set a variable to tell how many iterations(or times) to loop
-basic examples are of printing words or writing a sentence but a loop can be used to keep purchasing on a shopping bot or anything repetitive
-a great way to reduce the amount of work for your self
-you could also loop through a list to print each of them


Ex:

i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  i += 1

Looping through list:

languages = ["english", "spanish", "french", "italian", "mandarin"]

for language in languages:
  print(language)

#language is the element we are at in the loop
#languages is the list we are looping through
