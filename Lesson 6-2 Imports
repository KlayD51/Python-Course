Lesson 6-2 Imports

Do Now: Create a queue

Steps:
1.Create a queue(you can even steal the stack you made last class)
queue = []

2.Fill you queue with x amount of values(3 or 4 is fine)
queue.append(“First Element”)
queue.append(“Sec Element”)

3.Print your queue
print(queue)

4.Remove 2 elements
queue.pop(0)

4.Print again to see how it changed
print(queue)


Objectives:
-Queue refresher
-Imports
-Imports use cases
-Imports demo

Imports
-Imports are a way for you to import code/work someone else has done so that you don’t have to do it
-You can import anything from a random number generator to a script to steal wifi passwords
-Just about anything can be imported 
-Most coding)large Scale) is done using a lot of imports because why would you code something that someone already did
-Not considered stealing because it doesn’t make sense to reinvent the wheel
-Just have some idea of what your import will do to your code
-Imagine the queue you made for the do now just being imported to replit instead of you doing the work

I will leave 3 examples, try them to see what they do can do for you:

Datetime library lets you import the current date and time in a good format.

import datetime
oTime = datetime.datetime.now()
print oTime.isoformat()

Random library lets you generate random numbers.

import random
n = random.randint(0,22)
print(n)

Faker library gives fake info, name, address, etc. / Good so you don’t have to thing of fake data.

from faker import Faker
fake = Faker()
print(fake.name())
print(fake.address())
print(fake.password())

Exercise:
Use faker to make yourself an alias.
Get fake name
Get fake address
